			<h1>They Changed the World</h1>
			<img src = "smartphones.jpg" alt = "Most popular smart phones"/>
			<h2>Now, it's Your Turn.</h2>
			<h2>Presenting...</h2>
			<img src = "KiwiIcon@3x.png" alt = "Kiwi Logo Large"/>
			<h1>Kiwi Inc.</h1>
			<h2>We want YOU to design the next big thing</h2>
			<img src = "design-thinking.jpg" alt = "Pencil and Protractor"/>
			<h2>What if you could design a smartphone?</h2>
			<p>Introducing the new Kiwi Inc. uPhone, the first smartphone created by you, 
			for you. Kiwi Inc. wants to bring you the next big thing in the smartphone 
			industry but we would rather not be the only ones deciding the final product. 
			Instead, we have created a design plan called “crowd sourced synergy” but 
			we call it CSS for short.</p>
		
			<h2>A Phone for You by You</h2>
			<p>We wanted to gather the greatest designers, engineers and marketers to 
			develop the uPhone for the public but we have a budget. We used the lowest 
			common denominator, YOU, to tell us what we should and should not do for our 
			new devices. </p>
		
			<h2>We Need You</h2>
			<p>With your contributions, we can create the T-1000 of smartphones, capable 
			of annihilating Sarah Conner and the competition through a superior cybernetic 
			endoskeleton, for drop resistance, wrapped in living tissue for added grip. 
			We hope that you will give us the data required to prepare our flagship device 
			for all scenarios that could potentially endanger the proliferation of all Kiwi Inc. </p>
